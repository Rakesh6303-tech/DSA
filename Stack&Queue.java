Sure! Let’s go through **Queues and Stacks** in a simple and easy-to-understand way 👇

---

## 🧱 **STACK**

### **Definition:**

A **Stack** is a **linear data structure** that follows the
👉 **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle.
That means the **last element inserted** is the **first one removed**.

---

### **Example:**

Think of a **stack of plates** 🍽️
You put one plate on top → last plate you added is the first you take off.

---

### **Main Operations:**

1. **push(x)** → Add element `x` to the top of stack
2. **pop()** → Remove the top element
3. **peek() / top()** → View the top element without removing
4. **isEmpty()** → Check if stack is empty

---

### **Example in Action:**

| Operation | Stack (Top → Bottom) |
| --------- | -------------------- |
| push(10)  | 10                   |
| push(20)  | 20, 10               |
| pop()     | 10 (20 is removed)   |
| push(30)  | 30, 10               |

✅ **Output:** Top = 30

---

### **Used in:**

* Undo/Redo operations in editors
* Browser back/forward navigation
* Expression evaluation (like postfix/prefix)
* Function call stack in programming

---

## 🚌 **QUEUE**

### **Definition:**

A **Queue** is a **linear data structure** that follows the
👉 **FIFO (First In, First Out)** principle.
That means the **first element inserted** is the **first one removed**.

---

### **Example:**

Think of a **queue at a ticket counter** 🎟️
The first person in line gets the ticket first.

---

### **Main Operations:**

1. **enqueue(x)** → Add element `x` at the end
2. **dequeue()** → Remove element from the front
3. **front()** → View the first element
4. **isEmpty()** → Check if queue is empty

---

### **Example in Action:**

| Operation   | Queue (Front → Rear) |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| enqueue(10) | 10                   |
| enqueue(20) | 10, 20               |
| dequeue()   | 20 (10 removed)      |
| enqueue(30) | 20, 30               |

✅ **Output:** Front = 20

---

### **Used in:**

* Task scheduling
* Printer queue
* CPU process management
* Breadth-First Search (BFS) in graphs

---

## **Key Differences**

| Feature   | Stack                    | Queue                     |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Principle | LIFO (Last In First Out) | FIFO (First In First Out) |
| Insertion | push (top)               | enqueue (rear)            |
| Deletion  | pop (top)                | dequeue (front)           |
| Example   | Stack of books           | Line at counter           |

Would you like me to show a **simple diagram (boxes and arrows)** to visually explain Stack vs Queue? It makes it super easy to remember for interviews.
